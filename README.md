**Square and Multiply**

This is a simple implementation of the Square and Multiply algorithm.
It is used for example for the RSA encryption algorithm.


**Note!**

This is a implementation where Square and Multiply always
"shrinks" the temporary value, meaning it uses the modulo when
it should do both: binary 1 = (SM) square and multiply [mind tha in German SM is QM].
